# Topk-taupath

The topk-taupath algorithm described in "The TopK Tau-Path Screen for Monotone Association": https://arxiv.org/pdf/1509.00549.pdf

Caveat: This repository does _not yet_ include the high performance FastBCS2 implementation. The R  codeis forthcoming, and then I'll add Java and Golang as well. Cheers

# About

The goal of this repository is to provide implementations of the top-k taupath algorithm in multiple langauges. The key algorithm _FastBCS_ (Fast Backward Conditional Search) will be provided in its original form, in addition to the much faster _FastBCS2_. 

Many variable and function names refer to Joe Verducci and Srinath Sampath's original work lain out in their 2013 paper, _Detecting the end of agreement between two long ranked lists_. If a concept or variable name is unclear, their paper is a great resource https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/sam.11205. 

# Current Status 

As of 2019-7-20, the code here is very much a work in progress. Documentation is either poor or non-existent. Code is not well formatted or clearly lain out. Over time, I will add more langauges and implementations. 

The current goal is to make the full R source code available (both FastBCS and FastBCS2 implementations). 

# Todo 
* Make R _FastBCS_ ✅
* Make R _FastBCS2_ available 🛑
* Make Java _FastBCS_ and _FastBCS2_ available 🛑
* Make Go _FastBCS_ and _FastBCS2_ available 🛑
